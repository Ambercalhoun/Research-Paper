    <h4> By: Amber Calhoun </h4>
    <p> It's unbelivable that just a few decades ago, touchscreen technology could only be found in fiction books and film. Today, it's almost unfathomable how we once got through our daily tasks without a tablet or smartphone nearby, but it doesn't
      stop there. Touchscreens are everywhere. Homes, cars, restaurants, stores, planes, whereverâ€”they fill our lives in spaces public and private. </p>
