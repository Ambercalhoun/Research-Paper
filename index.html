    <h1>Touchscreens: Past, Present, and Future</h1>

  <div class="opening">
      <p> It's unbelivable that just a few decades ago, touchscreen technology could only be found in fiction books and film. Today, it's almost unfathomable how we once got through our daily tasks without a tablet or smartphone nearby, but it doesn't
      stop there. Touchscreens are everywhere. Homes, cars, restaurants, stores, planes, wherever—they fill our lives in spaces public and private. </p>

    <h2>Past</h2>  </div>
    <h3>The First Touchscreen</<h2>

      <div class="info">

        <p>The first touchscreen was invented in 1965 by Eric A. Johnson who worked at the Royal Radar Establishment in Malvern, England. His first article, "Touch display—a novel input/output device for computers" describes his work. The invention is known as a capacitive touchscreen, which uses an insulator, in this case glass, coated with a transparent conductor, like indium tin oxide. The persons finger also acts as a conductor and disturbs the capacitance of the conducting layer. In more simple terms, touching the screen causes a change in the electric charge that the computer detects. Johnson patented his design in 1966, improved it in 1968, and wrote another article in the same year. At some point, it was adopted by British air traffic controllers and was used later in the 1990s.

A few years after Johnsons invention, resistive touchscreen was invented by American inventor, scientist, health physicist, and educator Dr. G. Samuel Hurst. Hurst and his research team had been working at the University of Kentucky. The university tried to file a patent on his behalf to protect this invention from duplication, but due to the scientific background of his invention it didn’t seem valuable to everyday life. Although Hurst was not appreciated back then, his invention would pave the way for the advancements of touchscreen</p></div>

        <h3>First Consumer Models</h2>

  <div class="info">
     <p>Tech companies were starting to take notice of this new way to control computers. Hewlett-Packard was the first to release a product that put touchscreens in the hands of everyday users. He made a name for itself in the 1960s and 70s for creating smaller and smaller computers to the point where it had made one of the first machines to be called a personal computer. By 1969, HP was marketing a variety of touchscreen products and continued to issue new products, including their HP-35 hand-held calculator and several computers in the 1970s. In 1983, Hewlett-Packard released the HP-150, also known as the HP Touchscreen. However, the system had its faults: dust would get into the infrared holes and require vacuuming. The design wasn't ergonomic either, users would complain of muscle fatigue, or "Gorilla Arm" from keeping their arm outstretched and unsupported for long periods of time. The first taste of consumer touchscreen wasn’t very popular. In response to the negative feedback, HP released the HP Touchscreen II (touchscreen was optional). Granting touchscreen back then was unsuccessful, years later anything not touchscreen would be taboo.</p> </div>

        <h3>1990s: Popular Touchscreens </h3>
        <br>

        <div class="info">  <p>As computers continued to shrink, tech companies started seeing the possibilities of handheld devices. Apple released the MessagePad, also called the Newton, in 1993 as a new tool: the PDA. These used a touchscreen that was made for a stylus, and boasted a much anticipated feature: handwriting recognition. However, the high price point and problems interpreting user writing kept it from being successful. At this time, IBM released the first cellphone with a touchscreen, the Simon Personal Communicator. Today, it's recognized as the first true smartphone with a calendar, address book, and notepad.The Simon Personal computer laid down the immedaiate groundwork of what everyday smartphones look and work today. By the end of the 1990s, touchscreens became part of computer culture and interest increased. Wayne Westerman, a graduate student of the University of Delaware

published a doctoral dissertation about capacitive touchscreens in 1999 that would lead to their popularity today. He also formed the company FingerWorks to create new devices based on his findings.</p>

    <div class="Time">    <h3>Today: Touchscreen Explosion </h3>
    </div>

          <br>
          <div class="info">
<p>In 2007, the original iPhone was released and revolutionized the phone industry, featuring a touchscreen instead of a physical dialing pad. Smartphones became the number one device in communications and with them, this new style of input. The iPhone's touchscreen can change between a dialing pad, a keyboard, a video, a game, or a variety of other apps. The iPhone brought with it a capacitive touchscreen that included a brand-new feature for the consumer market: multi-touch. Apple claims it invented the technology, but in reality they purchased FingerWorks to assist in iPhone development and only popularized it

The Apple iPad was released in 2010, creating another market for touchscreen devices. The first truly mainstream tablet was apparently worked on before iPhone, and its release touches on a speech made in 1983 by Steve Jobs: "What we want to do is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20 minutes ... and we really want to do it with a radio link in it so you don’t have to hook up to anything and you’re in communication with all of these larger databases and other computers.</p> </div>
          <h2>Future</h2>
        <br>
      <div class="info">  <p>What if we could feel the screen when we touch it? Haptic technology, also known as kinaesthetic communication or 3D touch, refers to any technology that can create an experience of touch by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user. A touchscreen with advanced haptic technology could change to feel like different textures or feature physical bumps as buttons. This may seem as odd as flying cars, but its already in the works. It was demonstrated by Tanvas at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2017, featuring different types of fabric

What if the “touch” wasn’t limited to the screen? What if the screen could be projected onto any surface? OmniTouch attemptes to accomplish this by with a projector that puts the display on walls, tables, books, and even on human skin while a camera detects the input. Imagine answering a text on your arm rather than having to pull out your phone! The model showed in 2011 by Chris Harringon was a shoulder-mounted wearable computer. The "always-available" surface has not seen much development in recent years, but it might make a comeback when technology catches up</p> </div>
